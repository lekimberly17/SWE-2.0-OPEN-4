Determine whether or not the following is appropriately labeled? 
    let a = '4' // not specific
    // temperature

    const height = 35 // height is dynamic we should change it to a let variable

Data Primitives

    Symbol
    Number - Integers, decimals
    String - anything in double or single quotes
    boolean - True or False

    null - a variable that has data stored in it and the value is null
    undefined - a variable that has no data stored in it

        Example

            let data
            console.log("Data", data)

            let someInfo = null
            console.log("SomeInfo", SomeInfo)

Control Flow - conditional statement
        let budget = 1000
        const hotelRoomCost = 375

        // if my budget is more than the hotelroomcost -> go on trip
        // if not, I am too broke to travel

        if(budget > hotelRoomCost) {
            // this will execute of the condidition is met
            console.log('LETS PACK OUR BAGS AND GOOOO!')
        } else {
            // this condition will execute of the condition is false
            console.log('I'm too broke to go....')
        }



Conditional statement - if / else if / else

        let grade = "B"
        
        if(grade === "A") {
            // if this condition is met
            console.log("Excellent work!")
        } else if(grade === "C") {
            // if the orignal condition is not met but the else if condition is met
            console.log("Can improve")
        } else {
            // if all conditions are not met
            console.log("Come to office hours!!")
        }


Comparison Operators
    let height = 100

    (height >= 40)

    let budget = 3000

    (budget > 2000)

    const passport = true

    passport === true)

    console.log('equal to', 3 == '3') // true == 
    only compares the value not the data type
        // js will corece any numbers into a string and pare the two strings '3' == '3'
    console.log('strictly equals to', 3 === '3') // false === c
    ompares both value and data type 3 === '3'


Logical Operators
    let budget = 3000
    let passport = true

    (budget >= 4000 && passport === true) // How is this conditional
    statement evaluated
