Control Flow [x]
    1. What is control flow? Provide an example of control flow.
        - Control flow is the way the program makes decisions and chooses which 
        instructions to execute next.
        - Control flow statements if, else, else if - these will help us decide
        on which part of our code gets run and which part gets ignored. 

    2. What are conditional statements?
        - A conditional statement is a type of control flow that allows a
        program to make decisions based on certain conditions. They are used
        to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met and skip a
        block of code if the condition is false.

Comparison operators []
    1. What are the comparison operators in Javascript?

            3.
            4.

            6.
            7.
            8.

    2. What are comparison operators used for?
        -  Comparison operators are used to compare values or variables and make
        decisions based on the outcome of the comparison.

    3. Provide an example of how to use comparison operators. (demo)
        - What is the different between == and ===
            - == only compares the value
            - === compares both value and datatype

    4. Provide an example of how to use comparison operators using control flow. (demo)

Logical operators []

    1. What are the logical operators?
        - They are used in JS to combine multiple conditions in a single statement

    2. What are logical operators used for?
        && - AND
        || - OR

    3. How are logical operators evaulated?
        && (True && True) = True
        && (True && False) = False
        && (False && False) = True

        || (True || False) = True
        || (True || True) = True
        || (False || False) = False
