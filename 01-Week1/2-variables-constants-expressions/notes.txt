Introduction:

Data primitives [ ]
    What are the 6 primitive data types in Javascript?
        1. Numbers
        2. Strings - sequence of characters. They are used to represent texts and are enclosed in quotation marks. (double or single quotation)
        3. Boolean - True or False ( often used in conditions and control flow)
        4. Undefined - a variable that is declared but not assigned a value. It's assigned the value of 'undefined'
        5. Symbol - New data primitive (ES6) - it is unique and immutable value that is intended to be used as identifiers for object properities
        6. Null - represents no value or no object. 
Variables vs Constants [ ]

    What is a variable?
        - A container that holds a value.

    What is the main difference between variables and constants in JavaScript?
        - A variable is a container that holds a value that you can reassign.
        - A constant is a container that holds a value that you cannot reassign (change).

    When would you use a variable and when would you use a constant?
        - Use a variable when you expect the value to change (score in a game, user age, birthday)
        - Use a constant when you expect the value to stay static (importing modules, port number)

let and const [ ]

    What is the difference between 'let' and 'const'?
        - 'let' - helps us create a variable that we can reassign.
        - 'const' - helps us creare a variable that we cannot reassign.

    How do we declare a variable using the keyword 'let' and 'const'?
        - use the keyword 'let' followed by a name of the variable -> equal sign -> data
        - use the keyword 'const' followed by a name of the variable -> equal sign -> data

    What is the difference between using let and const when declaring a variable?
        - let creates a variable that you can change
        - const creates a variable that you cannot change

    How do we reassign a variable?
        - you can only reassign let variables.
        - to reassign, simply just write the name of the let variable followed by - and the new value
   
Expressions and evaluation [ ]

    What are expressions in JavaScript?
        - Expressions is a piece of code that can be evaluted to a value.
        - Expressions can be a combination of literals, operators, and function calls

    How does JavaScript evaluate expressions?

    
other examples:
        3 + 4
        "Hello, " + "world!"
        Math.sqrt(16)
        myVariable * 2
        (5 > 2) ? "Yes" : "No"
    
console.log [x]
    What is the console.log() function in JavaScript?
    When is it useful to use console.log() in your code?
    Can you give an example of how you would use console.log() in a script?

Comments [x]
        What are comments in JavaScript?
        How to write a comment in JS?

        - // to write a line
        - /* */ to write multiple lines
